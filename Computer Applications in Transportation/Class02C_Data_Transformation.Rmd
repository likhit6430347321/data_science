## ==== First things first ====

Set working directory and call packages.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Call required packages, ex. "readxl", "tidyverse"
if(!require(readxl)){install.packages("readxl")}
if(!require(tidyverse)){install.packages("tidyverse")}
if(!require(rcompanion)){install.packages("rcompanion")}
if(!require(DescTools)){install.packages("DescTools")}
if(!require(Hmisc)){install.packages("Hmisc")}
if(!require(corrplot)){install.packages("corrplot")}
if(!require(formatR)){install.packages("formatR")}
```

## ==== Tidy Data ====

In real life, datasets hardly ever come in exactly the right structure. Here, you'll learn the principles of tidy data, which help you organize your data in a way that makes it easy to visualize with `ggplot2`, manipulate with `dplyr` and model with the many modelling packages. The principles of tidy data are supported by the `tidyr` package, which helps you tidy messy datasets.

The principle behind tidy data is simple: storing your data in a consistent way makes it easier to work with it. Tidy data is a mapping between the statistical structure of a data frame (variables and observations) and the physical structure (columns and rows).

Tidy data follows two main principles:

1.  Variables go in columns.

2.  Observations go in rows.

Tidy data is particularly important for `ggplot2` because the job of `ggplot2` is to map variables to visual properties: if your data isn't tidy, you'll have a hard time visualizing it.

Sometimes you'll find a dataset that you have no idea how to plot. That's normally because it's not tidy. For example, take this data frame that contains monthly employment data for the United States:

![](Image/Unemployment.png){width="600"}

Imagine you want to plot a time series showing how unemployment has changed over the last 10 years. Can you picture the `ggplot2` command you'd need to do it? What if you wanted to focus on the seasonal component of unemployment by putting months on the x-axis and drawing one line for each year? It's difficult to see how to create those plots because the data is not tidy. There are three variables, month, year and unemployment rate, but each variable is stored in a different way:

-   `month` is stored in a column.

-   `year` is spread across the column names.

-   `rate` is the value of each cell.

To make it possible to plot this data we first need to tidy it. There are two important pairs of tools:

-   Spread & gather

-   Separate & unite

## ==== Spread and Gather ====

Take a look at the two tables below:

![](Image/original-dfs-tidy.png){width="600"}

If you study them for a little while, you'll notice that they contain the same data in different forms. I call the first form **indexed** data (a **long** format), because you look up a value using an index (the values of the `x` and `y` variables). I call the second form **Cartesian** data (a **wide** format), because you find a value by looking at intersection of a row and a column.

Also note the missing values: missing values that are explicit in one form may be implicit in the other. An `NA` is the presence of an absence; but sometimes a missing value is just the absence of a presence.)

Tidying your data will often require translating Cartesian to indexed forms, called **gathering**, and less commonly, indexed to Cartesian, called **spreading**. The `tidyr` package provides the `spread()` and `gather()` functions to perform these operations.

### Gather

`gather()` has four main arguments:

-   `data`: the dataset to translate.

-   `key` & `value`: the key is the name of the variable that will be created from the column names, and the value is the name of the variable that will be created from the cell values.

-   `...`: which variables to gather. You can specify individually, `A, B, C, D`, or as a range `A:D`. Alternatively, you can specify which columns are *not* to be gathered with `-`: `-E, -F`.

To tidy the economics dataset shown above, you first need to identify the variables: `year`, `month` and `rate`. `month` is already in a column, but `year` and `rate` are in Cartesian form, and we want them in indexed form, so we need to use `gather()`. In this example, the key is `year`, the value is `unemp` and we want to select columns from `2006` to `2015`.

Note that the columns have names that are not standard variable names in R (they don't start with a letter). This means that we need to surround them in back-ticks, i.e. `` `2006` `` to refer to them.

We use `convert = TRUE` to automatically convert the years from character strings to numbers, and `na.rm = TRUE` to remove the months with no data. (In some sense the data isn't actually missing because it represents dates that haven't occurred yet.)

When the data is in this form, it's easy to visualize in many different ways. For example, we can choose to emphasize either long term trend or seasonal variations.

### Gather with `pivot_longer`

To change from wide to long use `tidyr::pivot_longer`, which puts column data into rows.

We want the column names into "`var`" variable in the output dataset and the value in "`number`" variable. We then describe which columns we want to "gather".

```{r Gather, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=80)}
# Read CSV file with `read_csv`
unemp_wide <- read_csv("/Users/slick/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-ChulalongkornUniversity/University/Senior/Comp App Trans/Data/unemployment.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
unemp_wide
# Change from wide to long format (Cartesian to Indexed)
unemp_long <- gather(unemp_wide, key = "year", value = "unemp", `2006`:`2015`)
unemp_long
# Alternatively, we could gather all columns except month
# Then, arrange by month and remove NA
unemp_long2 <- gather(unemp_wide, key = "year", value = "unemp", -"month")
unemp_long2 <- unemp_wide %>%
  gather(key = "year", value = "unemp", -"month") %>%
  arrange(month) %>%
  na.omit()
unemp_long2
# Gather with pivot_longer 
unemp_long3 <- pivot_longer(unemp_wide, names_to = "year", values_to = "unemp", -"month") %>%
  na.omit()
unemp_long3
# Check if unemp_long2 = unemp_long3
identical(unemp_long2, unemp_long3)
# To emphasise either long term trend or seasonal variations.
ggplot(unemp_long, aes(as.numeric(year) + (month - 1)/12, unemp)) +
  geom_line()
ggplot(unemp_long, aes(month, unemp, group = year)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = year), size = 1)
```

### Spread

`spread()` is the opposite of `gather()`. You use it when you have a pair of columns that are in indexed form, instead of Cartesian form. The following example dataset contains three variables (`day`, `rain` and `temp`), but `rain` and `temp` are stored in indexed form.

Spread allows us to turn this messy indexed form into a tidy Cartesian form. It shares many of the arguments with `gather()`. You'll need to supply the `data` to translate, as well as the name of the `key` column which gives the variable names, and the `value` column which contains the cell values. Here the key is `obs` and the value is `val`.

### Spread with `pivot_wider`

In `tidyr`, the `pivot_wider` function spreads rows into columns. Now we have a long data set, but we want to separate the Average, Alightings and Boardings into different columns.

```{r Spread, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=80)}
# Construct a data frame
weather_long <- dplyr::tibble(
  day = rep(1:3, 2),
  obs = rep(c("temp", "rain"), each = 3),
  val = c(c(23, 22, 20), c(0, 0, 5))
)
# Print out weather
weather_long
# Change from long to wide format (Indexed to Cartesian)
weather_wide <- spread(weather_long, key = "obs", value = "val") 
weather_wide
# Spread with pivot_wider
weather_wide2 <- pivot_wider(weather_long, names_from = "obs", values_from = "val")
weather_wide2
# Check if weather_wide = weather_wide2
identical(weather_wide, weather_wide2)
```

## ==== Separate and Unite ====

Spread and gather help when the variables are in the wrong place in the dataset. Separate and unite help when multiple variables are crammed into one column, or spread across multiple columns.

For example, the following dataset stores some information about the response to a medical treatment. There are three variables (time, treatment and value), but time and treatment are jammed in one variable together:

The `separate()` function makes it easy to tease apart multiple variables stored in one column. It takes four arguments:

-   `data`: the data frame to modify.

-   `col`: the name of the variable to split into pieces.

-   `into`: a character vector giving the names of the new variables.

-   `sep`: a description of how to split the variable apart. This can either be a regular expression, e.g. `_` to split by underscores, or `[^a-z]` to split by any non-letter, or an integer giving a position.

In this case, we want to split by the `_` character:

(If the variables are combined in a more complex form, have a look at `extract()`. Alternatively, you might need to create columns individually yourself using other calculations. A useful tool for this is `mutate()`.)

`unite()` is the inverse of `separate()` - it joins together multiple columns into one column. This is less common, but it's useful to know about as the inverse of `separate()`.

```{r Separate, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=80)}
# Construct a data frame
trt <- dplyr::tibble(
  var = paste0(rep(c("beg", "end"), each = 3), "_", rep(c("a", "b", "c"))),
  val = c(1, 4, 2, 10, 5, 11)
)
# Print out trt
trt
# to split by the "_" character
trt2 <- separate(trt, var, c("time", "treatment"), "_")
trt2
# Spread with pivot_wider
trt3 <- spread(trt2, "time", "val")
trt3
# Check a class of trt3
class(trt3)
# Transpose trt3
trt4 <- t(trt3)
```

## ==== Case studies ====

### Blood pressure

The first step when tidying a new dataset is always to identify the variables. Take the following simulated medical data. There are seven variables in this dataset: name, age, start date, week, systolic & diastolic blood pressure. Can you see how they're stored?

1.  The first step is to convert from Cartesian to indexed form.

2.  We have two variables combined together in the `bp` variable. This is a common way of writing down the blood pressure, but analysis is easier if we break it into two variables. That's the job of `separate()`.

3.  This dataset is now tidy, but we could do a little more to make it easier to use. Use `extract()` to pull the week number out into its own variable (using **regular expressions** is beyond the scope of the book, but `\\d` stands for any digit) and use `arrange()` to order the rows to keep the records for each person together.

You might notice that there's some repetition in this dataset: if you know the name, then you also know the age and start date. This reflects a third condition of tidyness that I don't discuss here: each data frame should contain one and only one dataset. Here there are really two datasets: information about each person that doesn't change over time, and their weekly blood pressure measurements.

```{r Blood pressure, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=80)}
# Construct a data frame called "bpd"
bpd <- readr::read_table(
"name age      start  week1  week2  week3
Anne  35 2014-03-27 100/80 100/75 120/90
 Ben  41 2014-03-09 110/65 100/65 135/70
Carl  33 2014-04-02 125/80   <NA>   <NA>
", na = "<NA>")
bpd
# Gather with pivot_longer and gather
bpd_long <- gather(bpd, "Week", "Blood_Pressure", week1:week3)
bpd_long
bpd_long <- pivot_longer(bpd, names_to = "Week", values_to = "Blood_Pressure", week1:week3)

# Tidying "bpd" use gather, separate, extract and arrange
tidy_bpd <- bpd %>%
  gather("Week", Blood_Pressure, week1:week3) %>%
  separate(Blood_Pressure, c("high", "low"), "/")
tidy_bpd %>%
  extract(Week, "week", "(\\d)", convert = T) %>%
  arrange(name, week)

  
  
  
```

### Test scores

Imagine you're interested in the effect of an intervention on test scores. You've collected the following data. The variables are person, test, pre-test score and post-test score.

1.  As usual, we start by converting columns in Cartesian form (`test1` and `test2`) to indexed form (`test` and `score`).

2.  `pre` and `post` should be variables, not values, so we need to spread `time` and `score`.

3.  A good indication that we have made a tidy dataset is that it's now easy to calculate the statistic of interest: the difference between pre- and post-intervention scores.

```{r Test scores, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=80)}
# Construct a data frame called "scores"
scores <- dplyr::tibble(
  person = rep(c("Greg", "Sally", "Sue"), each = 2),
  time   = rep(c("pre", "post"), 3),
  test1  = round(rnorm(6, mean = 80, sd = 4), 0),
  test2  = round(jitter(test1, 15), 0)
)
scores
scores$time <- factor(scores$time, levels = c("pre", "post"))
# Tidying "scores" with gather, spread, mutate to construct "diff" of test scores
tidy_scores <- scores %>%
  gather(test, score, test1:test2) %>%
  spread(time, score) %>%
  mutate(diff = post - pre)
tidy_scores[,c(1,2,4,3,5)]
  
  
  
# Plot score progress from test1 to test2
ggplot(tidy_scores, aes(person, diff, color = test)) +
  geom_hline(size = 2, colour = "white", yintercept = 0) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path(aes(group = person), colour = "grey50", 
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm")))

```
